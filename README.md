# HTDR Crop Labor Trafficking Dashboard

This repo contains the python code for an agricultural dashboard aimed at combating human trafficking by better equiping law enforcement with the information needed to perform their duties. This app leverages data from the US Department of Agriculture and their computer vision model, CroplandCROS, in coordination with geospatial data to help identify potential locations for sites of labor trafficking based upon anecdotes from victims.
